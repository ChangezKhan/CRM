# Create custom relate field where options built from records from another modules

### Consider, we have two modules `A` & `B`. And we want to show all records of module `A`, to show in module `B` as a dropdown. So, first we will create a logic hook in module `A` to get all records and store it into any dropdown. At first, we need to create new dropdown using `Dropdown Editor`, so we can use it in our logic hook file.
